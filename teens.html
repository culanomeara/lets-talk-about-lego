            <p>This was my first Technic set. It was so different to 'normal' LEGO sets that I had seen before. This
                looked like an engineer's toy. It was a challenge in itself with so many new and interesting pieces and
                building methods.<br><br>
                <b>FEATURES: </b>We're not mentioning price here due to the fact that it didn't cost very much and it
                still doesn't today. It was released in 1986. You could build five different models from this one set:
                Cart, Windmill, Helicopter, Vent Fan and Crane.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Whilst this set came out in 1983, it was only later in life that I got my hands on it. As i got into ym teens, the basic sets had less appeal and it became more about Technic and also about building a big city out of LEGO. This set was the first part of that project. It had police cars(to chase the speeding F1 car, a proper building and a helicopter! How cool was that?)  <br><br>
                <b>PRICE: </b>A relatively expensive set at the time of release in 1984 costing approxiamtely IR£36, it would cost you €850 to get your hands on a new set now.

            <p>A small set but it is what it signified for me that makes it memorable. It was the first set that was water-based. We all have attachements to our firsts...and this is no different. Small but most definitely mighty. A great addition to my waterside LEGO city. <br><br>
                <b>PRICE: </b>Cost very little back then and not much different now at €50 for a new set.
