            <p>This was my first Technic set. It was so different to 'normal' LEGO sets that I had seen before. This
                looked like an engineer's toy. It was a challenge in itself with so many new and interesting pieces and
                building methods.<br><br>
                <b>FEATURES: </b>We're not mentioning price here due to the fact that it didn't cost very much and it
                still doesn't today. It was released in 1986. You could build five different models from this one set:
                Cart, Windmill, Helicopter, Vent Fan and Crane.

            <p>Hi. My name is Culan O'Meara and I'm a big LEGO fan. Now, you may well ask, what a middle-aged man is
                doing playing with a toy? Well, here's the thing: LEGO is not just for kids. The LEGO compnay have
                realised that making sets specifically for adults may not be such a bad idea. The set shown here, the
                LEGO Technic Bugatti Chiron was a real groundbreaking set. It was huge with 3599 pieces. The box and
                presentation was really luxurious and high-end(kind of what you'd expect if you bought an actual Bugatti
                Chiron) <br><br>
