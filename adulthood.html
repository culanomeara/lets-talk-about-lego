            <p>This set was the start of me falling back in love with LEGO as an adult. It is the most fun build ever
                and it's full of so many cool features including a sushi restaurant, comicbook store, a soda vending
                machine. It was a very big set and came out in conjunction with the Lego Ninjago Movie.<br><br>
                <b>PRICE: </b>It was released in 2017 at a price of €299. Today, the set sells for over €600 if new and
                unboxed. However, the great thing is even a used set will sell for over €500. You get to make it, play
                with it and then sell it on for a tidy profit.

            <p>Hi. My name is Culan O'Meara and I'm a big LEGO fan. Now, you may well ask, what a middle-aged man is
                doing playing with a toy? Well, here's the thing: LEGO is not just for kids. The LEGO compnay have
                realised that making sets specifically for adults may not be such a bad idea. The set shown here, the
                LEGO Technic Bugatti Chiron was a real groundbreaking set. It was huge with 3599 pieces. The box and
                presentation was really luxurious and high-end(kind of what you'd expect if you bought an actual Bugatti
                Chiron) <br><br>
