            <p>This is one of my first ever sets and definitely one of my all-time favourites.
                I remember playing with this and other space lego sets for hours.
                A bigger version of it appeared in the LEGO Movie and only recently has been rebooted with a brand new upgraded set.
                I found it again recently when clearing out my attic and it still gives me pleasure!<br><br>
                <b>PRICE: </b>It was released in 1979 at a price of IR£29.
                If you were clver enough to put it away(still in box), you'd be able to sell it for around €1500!
                Extremely rare to find a new, unopened one of these. To be fair, who buys LEGO and doesn't open it?
