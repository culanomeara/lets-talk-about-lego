# Let's Talk About Lego

This site is for those that are curious about LEGO and specifically for those that are curious about why a middle-aged man would love it so much. I will walk you through my life in LEGO. The site will give you a whistlestop tour of the most significant/memorable LEGO sets I own from childhood to now and hopfeully give you a sense of the lifelong appeal of LEGO. I hope you enjoy the journey...

## Features 

The website features a vertical scrolling 'timeline' presentation to match up with the idea of telling a story of my life thru LEGO of which there are 3 parts: childhood, teens and adulthood(with kids). As it is one page plus a form/quiz page, the sections have navigations to scroll down to them within the single page.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured at top of the page, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Childhood section, Teen section, Adulthood sections and to Contact page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from section to section, page to apge across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
  - When screens get below 600px,the nav bar will collapse into a hamburger menu(expcet for HOME link). If clicked, the hamburger will give the user the nav menu vertically to avoid display issues and be more user-friendly.

- __The banner__

  - The banner includes a photograph with site title to allow the user to see exactly what this site is about and who it would would be applicable to.
  - The background image is colourful and eye-catching. It has been styled to have some opacity so as not to overpower the user.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator]()
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fculanomeara.github.io%2Flets-talk-about-lego%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, click on the Settings icon 
  - On the left-hand menu, click on Pages
  - From the options that appear, select Deploy from branch, then select MAIN
  - Once I saved those changes, the site was live. It took about 10 mins before I could see the site.
